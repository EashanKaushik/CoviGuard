# CoviGuard

This application is built keeping in mind all the functionalities a user might and will need if this was to go in production. CoviGuard is a platform for Covid related updates and alerts for the people of New York. Users will be able to create circles and add their friends, colleagues, or relatives to multiple groups which would open them to information like Covid cases among their family and friends. It allows the user to view Covid cases in the state of New York through a number of interactive graphs and maps. Users will be kept motivated through streaks for updating their locations regularly. Register today for a power packed application that helps you stay safe and fight against Covid.
